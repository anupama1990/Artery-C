In this example the network consists of one UE connected to one gNB and a MEC system composed of a MEC host. 
The UE app run outside the simulator. The UE injects (and receives) packets through the ExtLowerEthernetInterface
module of the UE.

We configure the following scenario:

   +++++++++++++++++++++++++     +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
   +     Namespace ns1     +     +         Simu5G        +
   +                       +     +                       +
   +  Ue App         [veth1]<--->[sim-veth1]             +
   +            192.168.3.2+     +                       +
   +                       +     +                       + 
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++     +++++++++++++++++++++++++

IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files (see "routing" folder).
The Ue App contacts the DeviceApp within the simulation. The DeviceApp contacts the UALCMP to 
obtain the IP address/port of the simulated MEC App. Then, the ClientApp subscribes to information from
the MEC Location Service. The MEC App sends notifications to the ClientApp when the UE enters/leaves a 
specific geographical zone.

 
=== HOW TO BUILD AND RUN ===

1) Make sure that the emulation feature is enabled in the INET project:

- via the IDE: right-click on the 'inet' folder in the Project Explorer -> Properties;
               select OMNeT++ -> Project Features; 
               tick the box "Network emulation support".
- via the command line: in the root INET folder, type 'opp_featuretool enable NetworkEmulationSupport'.

  If the feature was disabled, recompile INET with the command 'make' (in the root INET folder).  


2) In order to be able to send/receive packets through sockets, set the application permissions: 

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_dbg
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_release


3) Compile Simu5G from the command line by running (in the root Simu5G folder):
    $ . setenv
	$ make makefiles
	$ make 
	 	
	 	 	
4) Setup the environment by typing:

    ./setup.sh	 
	 	

5) Run the simulation by typing:

    ./run.sh
   
6) Launch the UE App:

    (in a new terminal window) sudo ip netns exec ns1 python3 UeApp.py
    
     
7) Clean the environment by typing:

    ./teardown.sh
