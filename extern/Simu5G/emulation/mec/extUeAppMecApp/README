In this example the network consists of one UE connected to one gNB, and a MEC system composed of a MEC host. 
Both the UE app and the MEC app run outside the simulator. 
The former injects (and receives) packets through the ExtLowerEthernetInterface module of the UE.
The external MEC app, instead, communicates with the simulator via the ExtLowerEthernetInterface module
of the virtualisation infrastructure of the MEC host, as if it were actually deployed on the MEC host.

We configure the following scenario:

   +                       +     +                       +     +                       +
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++     +++++++++++++++++++++++++     +++++++++++++++++++++++++
   
IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files (see "routing" folder).
The UeApp contacts the DeviceApp within the simulation. The DeviceApp contacts the UALCMP to 
obtain the IP address/port of the (external) MEC App. Then, the UeApp subscribes to information from
the MEC Location Service. The MEC App sends notifications to the UeApp when the UE enters/leaves a 
specific geographical zone.
   
   
   
=== HOW TO BUILD AND RUN ===

1) Make sure that the emulation feature is enabled in the INET project:

- via the IDE: right-click on the 'inet' folder in the Project Explorer -> Properties;
               select OMNeT++ -> Project Features; 
               tick the box "Network emulation support".
- via the command line: in the root INET folder, type 'opp_featuretool enable NetworkEmulationSupport'.

  If the feature was disabled, recompile INET with the command 'make' (in the root INET folder).  


2) In order to be able to send/receive packets through sockets, set the application permissions: 

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_dbg
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_release


3) Compile Simu5G from the command line by running (in the root Simu5G folder):
    $ . setenv
	$ make makefiles
	$ make 
	 	
4) Setup the environment by typing:

    ./setup.sh	 

6) Launch the MEC App:

    (in a new terminal window) sudo ip netns exec ns1 python3 MecApp.py

	 	
5) Run the simulation by typing:

    ./run.sh
    
6) Launch the UeApp:

    (in a new terminal window) sudo ip netns exec ns2 python3 UeApp.py
    
7) Clean the environment by typing:

    ./teardown.sh
