The simulations/NR/tutorial folder includes simulation examples that are intended to provide
hints about the basic configurations of 5G NR networks.

The omnetpp.ini file is composed of several sections, each of which extends the scenario provided
by the previous one. This way, the beginner user is provided with a step-by-step guide towards 
scenarios with increasing complexities.    

All the configurations use the SingleCell_Standalone network that can be found in the
simulations/NR/networks folder.



===== (1) Single-UE =====

This simple scenario simulates only one UE attached to one gNB, with downlink traffic. The UE is 
located 400 meters far from the gNB and receives 800 kbps CBR traffic from a remote server.  

Since this scenario does not include any inter-cell interference and the gNB is lightly loaded
(it is serving one UE only), you will observe that the throughput received by the UE is equal 
to the throughput generated by the server. 
See 'cbrReceivedThroughput:mean' and 'cbrGeneratedThroughput:mean' statistics.
=========================



===== (2) BgTraffic =====

This configurations adds inter-cell interference to the previous configuration. To do this, the scenario 
simulates one background cell, which serves 10 background UEs. Each babkground UEs receives 800 kbps CBR
traffic. 
NOTE: Background cells/UEs are simplified models of cells/UEs and have the only purpose to create 
interference on foreground cells/UEs. See the following paper for more information:

   G. Nardini, G. Stea, A. Virdis, "Scalable Real-time Emulation of 5G Networks with Simu5G",
       IEEE Access, vol. 9, pp. 148504-148520, 2021. doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123873.

Due to the presence of interference you will observe smaller CQI for the foreground UE, as well as higher
number of allocated Resource Blocks in the downlink of the foreground cell. 
See 'averageCqiDl:mean' and 'avgServerBlocksDl:mean' statistics.

==========================



===== (3) Multiple-UEs =====

This configuration adds a variable number of (foreground) UEs (from 1 to 20) in the (foreground) gNB. 
All of them receive 800 kbps CBR traffic from a remote server.

Due to the increased offered load, you will observe higher number of allocated Resource Blocks in the
downlink of the foreground cell. In particular, you will observe that the allocated RBs will reach the 
maximum number of available RBs in this scenario (6). As a consequence, some UEs will experience a lower
throughput than the throughput generated at the server. 
See 'avgServerBlocksDl:mean' and 'cbrReceivedThroughput:mean' statistics.

===========================


===== (4) Carrier Aggregation =====

This configuration enables a second Component Carrier (CC) at the gNBs. Thus, the UEs will be allocated 
into the second CC when the RBs in the first one are terminated. 

Due to the higher radio capacity available, you will observe higher number of allocated Resource Blocks in the
downlink of the foreground cell, but you will also observe that UEs will get higher throughput than the 
previous scenario. 
See 'avgServerBlocksDl:mean' and 'cbrReceivedThroughput:mean' statistics.

===================================



===== (5) Numerology =====

This configuration shows how to change the numerology (u=0,1,2) assigned to all Component Carriers (CC).  

When numerology increases, you will observe that the number of allocated Resource Blocks will decrease and
more UEs will get higher throughput. 
See 'avgServerBlocksDl:mean' and 'cbrReceivedThroughput:mean' statistics.
