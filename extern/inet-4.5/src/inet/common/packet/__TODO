 - chunk queue and various chunk buffers don't have region tags, there's no place to store data specific tags from packets when reassembling data
 - add ChunkStack (lifo) similarly to how ChunkQueue (fifo) is implemented
 - add test and check for std::dynamic_pointer_cast<Subclass1>(chunk->peek<Subclass1>()) != nullptr always holds when peek uses a variant type deserializer

 - Chunk.msg:
   - _getChunk -> getChunk
   - _packet -> packet

 - cleanup PCAP recording
   - can happen at and is provided by network interfaces
   - doesn't have to be supported by specific MAC/PHY/etc. layer modules
   - can be done at lower layer and/or upper layer gates of network interfaces
   - can record inbound and/or outbound packets
   - can record each packet start and/or packet end and/or packet progress
   - can be used to aggregate packets for network interface/network node/network level
   - is configured by default to record the packet end for both inbound and outbound packets (PHY) at the lower layer gates of network interfaces
   - document everything about this in the User's Guide
