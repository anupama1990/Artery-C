 - fix UDP ephemeral port setting: if chosen & stored in UDP, sending further dgrams need to look it up from the SockDesc...

 - finish making gate names consistent in RTP modules

 - generic TCP/UDP socket tagging, with automatic copying of tags to outgoing packets

 - TCP,UDP,SCTP: Need revision for PORT_ANY usage:
   unspec port should be 0 not -1
   What will the PORT_ANY value: -1 or 0.
   Where do replace from PORT_ANY to a valid port: in TCPSocket or in
      TCPConnection::process_OPEN_ACTIVE/process_OPEN_PASSIVE
   Check it in other protocols.

 - TCPSegment, UDPPacket: use uint16_t for ports, uint32_t for sequence numbers, etc; also in the code!!!
   hint: first replace it somewhere with a type that CANNOT be cast to integer types, then let compile errors propagate the type change everywhere

 - added userId to TCPCommand -- rewrite TCPSocketMap to make use of userId
   - socket must be inserted into map before bind(), so that a userId can be assigned
   - what about incoming connections? how to assign userId to them?
           IF IT CANNOT BE DONE: remove userId from TCP!!!!

 - TCP: how to handle ICMP error reports?

 - TCP: Slow Start should be applied every time TCP starts to send "after a sufficiently long idle period".
   "Idle" could be interpreted as when the send queue is empty (there's nothing
   to send), and there's no unacknowledged data (i.e. previously sent segments
   have all been acknowledged). But what is "sufficiently long"? I guess that
   should be measured in RTT rather than absolute time (secs). So maybe we
   should say 5*RTT is "sufficiently long"?
