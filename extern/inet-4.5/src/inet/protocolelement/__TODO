considerations for generic modular packet processing elements:
 - modules implement the same set of interfaces
 - gates are either passive or active
   active output gate is connected to a passive input gate (push)
   passive output gate is connected to an active input gate (pull)
 - communication between elements is either synchronous (push/pull) or asynchronous (send)
   - packets can be sent to and received from gates asynchronously
   - packets can be pushed to or pulled from gates synchronously
 - processing granularity is either
   - passing a packet as a whole
   - streaming packet start, progress, and end
 - processing of a single element can be (input -> output):
   - passing: passing in -> passing out
   - streaming: passing in -> streaming out
   - destreaming: streaming in -> passing out
   - streaming through: streaming in -> streaming out
