# This script is intended to run INET simulations in sanitize mode. It can be used
# only after the 'setenv' script has been run from both the OMNeT++ and the INET
# top level directory using the '. setenv' command. To run a simulation, simply
# go into its directory and run 'inet_sanitize' possibly passing additional command
# line arguments. Please note that both OMNeT++ and INET must be compiled in sanitize
# mode using 'make MODE=sanitize' before.
