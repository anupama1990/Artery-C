- Ieee80211LevelOfDetail: packet level: Implicit chunk serialization is disabled to prevent unpredictable performance degradation (you may consider changing the Chunk::enableImplicitChunkSerialization flag or passing the PF_ALLOW_SERIALIZATION flag to peek) -- in module (inet::ieee80211::Rx) Ieee80211LevelofDetailShowcase.host[0].wlan[0].mac.rx (id=60), at t=0.374724514587s, event #15
- Ieee80211LevelOfDetail: bit level when out of communication range: The calculated data field length = 4032 is greater then the actual bitvector length = 1392 -- in module (inet::physicallayer::Ieee80211OFDMRadio) Ieee80211LevelofDetailShowcase.host[0].wlan[0].
- Netmask routes default metric should be higher than the metric of routes added by the configurator ? need some sensible default
- End-to-end-delay: needs byte-tags in the packet API. Fragmentation and packet timestamps are conflicting
- Crosstalk: partially overlapping config: channels 1-2 doesn't cause interference between packets being transmitted at the same time
- Ieee80211Visualizer doesn't work with simplified mgmt
- RadioMedium: When signal power is 0, the medium shouldn't send the signal (for example when behind a wall + simple obstacle loss)
- PcapRecorder: The timestamp in the pcap file (in wireshark) is not the same as the timestamp in the GUI
- Ieee80211Visualizer should indicate channel number
- Manetprotocols: f5f1406 ("manetprotocols", 2018-02-13): StatisticAodv3Uniform, runs 109, 122, 154, 153, 192, 225, 325, 360:
check_and_cast(): Cannot cast (inet::Packet*)ICMP-error-#1-type11-code0 to type 'inet::IcmpHeader *' -- in module (inet::aodv::Aodv) ManetprotocolsShowcaseMoreNodes.node11.routing (id=1130), at t=36.108710008528s, event #1718648
- Sensornetwork and Ieee802154 showcase: communication ranges not displayed
- ManetProtocols showcase: 2375584 ("manetprotocols", 2018-02-16): StatisticDymo config: 
Cannot serialize Udp header without turned off or properly computed CRC, try changing the value of crcMode parameter for Udp -- in module (inet::ieee80211::Tx) ManetprotocolsShowcaseMoreNodes.source.wlan[0].mac.tx (id=47), at t=0.010319113618s, event #24
(It doesn't throw error in Qtenv)
- apps use ModuleIdAddress if the network interface doesn't have an IP address configured, and UDP uses GNP which results in a weird error in MessageDispatcher
- XMac / sensornetwork showcase: at some slotTime values, the number of successfully sent packets drop. 
A sensor sends preambles -> the gateway wakes up and sends ack -> the sensor node would send the data but another sensor node 
starts sending preambles and the original sensor node's mac is stuck in SEND mode and doesnt do anything from this point. 
Eventually all sensor nodes get into this state and the number of successfully sent packets is low ~5 packets
- Ieee802154 showcase / StatisticVisualizer: 7594a70 ("sensornetwork", 2018-02-28): the statistic visualizer displays '-' as the number of received packets when there is one received packet
- Ieee802154NarrowbandScalarRadio: the packet don't have PHY header (according to the inspector)
- InfoVisualizer (and probably other visualizers): when DisplayHint = "bottom", the figure is on top of the module's name
- Sensornetwork: mac headerLength is set to 8b, but by default it's 10b (BMac, LMac) and 80b (XMac). This setting seems to be required for the macs to work correctly.
- SuperpositioningMobility should have faceForward (maybe all mobilities should?)
- SuperpositioningMobility: support for enabling orientation and position separatelly
- EntangledMobility vs AttachedMobility: support for enabling orientation and position separatelly

Planned Showcases:
------------------

-Hardware-in-the-loop: simulated AODV, real network
-Modeling radio interference:
	modeling radio interference -> distinct showcase -> noise sources (bg noise with
	spectrum; noise source with spectrum (and changing in time);
	->the features of the dimensional model
	wide noise, narrow noise,
-Corruption mode: corruption level and its effects on protocols (independent from wifi -> APSK radio)
-Throughput: add ht/vht mode
-Hud (distinct logical and physical views)
-UWBIR-Wifi coexistence: 802.15.4 MAC + APSK UWBIR radio + arbitrary packet level error model
-packetlog window showcase
 - understanding data
 - filtering
 - configure message display
 - TODO: regular expr.
 - TODO: OSI level
-Neuralnetworkerrormodel -> training data generation, training, error model generation -> include these
-Optimizing performance: recording, logging, event log, debug vs release - how they affect performance;
 sysprof; tests/speed folder;
