The CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege is required for using network namespaces in INET.
Changing the network namespace requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN authority for the
'setns()' function in the 'inet::NetworkNamespaceContext' constructor.
The next commands add this privilege to opp_run, so that all simulations run with this privilege.
This is dangerous because it enables several admin capabilities for all
running simulations, and it becomes a security hole (for more details, see CAP_SYS_ADMIN linux man pages; run command $> man 7 capabilities). Make sure to remove the
privilege after you're finished using network namespaces.

Run the following commands to add the CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege to opp_run:

$> sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg

To remove extra privileges after you're finished using network namespaces, use the following commands:

$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg
