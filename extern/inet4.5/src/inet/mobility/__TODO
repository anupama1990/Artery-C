 - separate initial positioning from positioning over time
 - make them composable sequentially and additively
 - extend interface with future movement predictions
 - cleanup implementation with respect to base classes, overriding base methods, etc.
 - fix mobility non-determinism caused by interpolation from last position during animation
 - validate Rotation, Quaternion, EulerAngles against each other and documentation
 - validate positioning and orientation IMobility, PhysicalEnvironment, ObstacleLoss
 - add geographic mobility modules (separate Euclidean and geographic mobilities)
 - add parameter to mobility base which determines what should happen if the energy storage is depleted.
   For example, a drone should just stop, but a satellite should continue its motion.
