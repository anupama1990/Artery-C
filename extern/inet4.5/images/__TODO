Icons should be similar to those in omnetpp/block

Must have new icons
===================

-aggregator
 merges incoming packets and produces a single aggregated packet
-deaggregator
 cuts an aggregated packet into pieces and sends them along

-cloner
 copies incoming packet to each output
 
-configurator
 configures interfaces/nodes/networks during initialize

-connection
 represents a connection between two nodes (e.g. TCP)

-decapsulation
 removes protocol headers from a packet
-encapsulation
 inserts protocol headers into a packet

-fragmenter
 splits up incoming packets and produces multiple fragments
-defragmenter
 concatenates incoming fragments and produces a single packet

-duplicator
 duplicates incoming packets and produces multiple copies

-energy consumer
 consumes energy over time
-energy generator
 generates energy over time
-energy storage
 stores energy over time
-energy managment
 manages node status (up/down) based on the energy storage state

-gate
 packets either go through or not depending on whether the gate is open or closed

-marker/tagger/labeler
 packets are tagged with some metainformation based on the data they contain

-meter
 some property of several packets going through is measured over time and attached to the packet

-mobility
 specifies movement in space over time

-policy
 determines some
 
-ratecontrol
 controls the speed of an interface

-scheduler (dual of classifier which already has a good icon)
 chooses packets from one of its sources

-serializer
 converts a packet from the native object based representation to its network byte order binary one
-deserializer
 converts a packet from its network byte order binary representation to the native object based one

-selectivity
 packets are either passed through or not depending on matching some data they must contain (e.g address/port)

-shaper
 a stream of packets are let through while shaping some property of the stream
 
-status
 controls node/interface up/down/etc. status

-streamer
 streams a packet received on its input as a whole to its output
-destreamer
 receives a streamed packet on its input and passes it as a whole to its output

-tokengenerator
 generates tokens (basically tokens are just a number) in other modules based on signals/packets/time/etc.

Probably should have new icons
==============================

-checksum checker
 drops incoming packets if the checksum is incorrect
-checksum inserter
 calculates and insert checksums into passing packets

-delayer
 delayes packets from input to output

-multiplexer
 passes/streams incoming packets from multiple inputs to a single output
-demultiplexer
 passes/streams outgoing packets to multiple outputs from a single input

-filter
 lets through packets or drops them depending on the filter criteria

-history
 lets through packets while keeping a copy of the last N packets

-server
 pulls packets from its input, processes them and pushes them to its output

-service
 combines multiple modules to form a generic complex service such as forwarding or data restructuring service

Already have good icons
