INET Framework Documentation
============================

Building the documentation website
----------------------------------

The INET documentation is built with the Sphinx tool (sphinx-doc.org).
A docker image is provided at: https://github.com/omnetpp/dockerfiles/tree/master/docker-sphinx

- Use './docker-make server' to run a local web server to preview the documentation.
- Use './docker-make html' or 'docker-make pdf' to build the documentation.
- Use './docker-make clean all' to build both the html and pdf version from scratch.
- Use 'make deploy' to create a new commit with the new version in the _deploy folder
  and then you can 'git push' it manually.

Alternatively, you can install sphinx locally,

  sudo apt install sphinx dvipng texlive-binaries texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-latex-extra
  python3 -m pip install --user -U Sphinx sphinxcontrib-images sphinxcontrib-doxylink sphinx-autobuild

and then use 'make' directly (instead of the docker) with the above targets. Don't forget to add ~/.local/bin 
to your path to be able to access the sphinx tools.
