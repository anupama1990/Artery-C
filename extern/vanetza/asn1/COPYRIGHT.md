These ASN.1 files are taken from their respective standardisation documents and are **not** licensed the same way as Vanetza itself.
Please refer to the referenced standardisation documents for details about the applicable Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To the best of my knowledge, ETSI does not object to bundling ASN.1 files of their published documents along with software.
Some editorial changes may have been applied, e.g. removal of trailing whitespace etc.
Code generated from the files located here can be found in the *vanetza/asn1/its* directory.
