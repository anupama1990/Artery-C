# InTAS
InTAS is the realistic Ingolstadt traffic scenario for SUMO. This scenario comprises the following features:

- **Modeled and Validated with real traffic numbers**
- 24 hours of simulation
- Actual road network based on the city of Ingolstadt
- Street categories for VANETs simulation: *tunnel*, *under.building*, *under.bridge*
- Simulation of public parking areas 
- Real location of all Traffic Lights in city
- Simulation of real Traffic Light Systems
- Buildings shape and location 
- Simulation of public transport system: *real bus routes with the actual time-table*

You can watch [InTAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgPeBxXzDHc) presentation for the SUMO User Conference 2020. 

*Developed and tested for SUMO 1.7.0*

## Actual State
- **Validation:** 24 points of traffic measurment
- **Simulation of Traffic Light System (TLS):** 20 TLS
- **Actual Scenario Error (NRMSE):** 0.33

## How To 
InTAS can be lauched from de cofiguration file:
- ```sumo -c InTAS_buildings.sumocfg```, considering:
  - *buildings*
  - *bus stops*
  - *E1 detectors*
  - *parking areas*
- ```sumo-gui -c InTAS_full_poly.sumocfg```, which provides full polygon bringing a nicer visualization and adds to the previous file:
  - *amenity*
  - *land use*
  - *water*
  - *leisure*
  - *forest*
